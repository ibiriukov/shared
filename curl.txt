Curl - Client URL

is a command line tool that enables data exchange between a device and 
a server through a terminal. Using this command line interface (CLI),
a user specifies a server URL (the location where they want to send a request)
and the data they want to send to that server URL.

API tools like Postman and Insomnia provide an interactive user interface 
(UI) that allows you to make different forms of requests to URLs, 
for receiving and processing requests. The cURL command does the same thing, 
except in your terminal. cURL works on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Curl commands:

curl -I https://google.com                   -----Get header
curl -L https://google.com                   -----follow redirection and get DOM of the page
curl -o index.html -L https://google.com     -- save DOM to the file (-o stands for output)
curl -X GET "https://api.genderize.io?name=sally"   --calling public API

curl --help
curl --version  



Header is:
API headers are like an extra source of information for each API call you make. 
Their job is to represent the meta-data associated with an API request and response.

Query parameters:
are appended to the end of the URL, using a '? '. 
The question mark sign is used to separate path and query parameters. 
If you want to add multiple query parameters, an '&' sign is placed in between them 
to form what is known as a query string.
